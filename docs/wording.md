# Wording

The following page outlines the various wording standards to make translating skills easier.

## Choice
Whether a player has a choice of whether a part of the skill activates depends if "can" was added. For example "You can discard X cards from that player" compared to "You discard X cards from that player" which means you have no choice.

There are many times where the skill ask you to do something then another part of the skill will happen. There's two different wording of this
* You can X, then Y
* You can X. If you do so, during Y, Z
The first scenario means that if you do something, then something else immediately happens.
The second scenario means that if you do something, then later on during Y something like Z will happen.

## Card vs Handcard
Card includes anything that is on the player, including equipment field, judgement field and hand cards. Whereas hand card just means the cards in the player's hand. To mention cards that include hand cards and equipment field, the text must specifically say so.

## Numbers
Whether numbers are written as literal numbers(1) or english numbers(one) depends on the situation
